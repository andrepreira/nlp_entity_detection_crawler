# NLP entity detection with crawler

This is a simple crawler that uses the [Spacy](https://spacy.io/) to detect entities in a given URL.

Entity detection in parsed HTML can be done using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging.

NER involves identifying and classifying named entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, and dates. POS tagging, on the other hand, involves assigning part-of-speech tags to words in text, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.

To use NLP for entity detection in parsed HTML, you can follow these steps:

1. Parse the HTML using an HTML parser such as BeautifulSoup to extract the text content.

2. Preprocess the text content by removing HTML tags, special characters, and other noise that might interfere with the entity detection process.

3. Use a pre-trained NER model such as spaCy or NLTK to detect named entities in the preprocessed text. These models typically classify named entities into categories such as PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc.

4. Use a POS tagging tool such as NLTK or Stanford CoreNLP to assign part-of-speech tags to the words in the preprocessed text.

5. Use the results of the NER and POS tagging to extract and classify entities in the parsed HTML, such as people's names, company names, locations, etc.

Overall, NLP can be a powerful tool for entity detection in parsed HTML, but it requires careful preprocessing and selection of appropriate models and tools for the task.
